## Admin

The website has an admin page that can only be accessed if the user is logged in as the "admin". Here are the admin credentials:
username: admin
password: admin

## Overview

This is a website that mocks what a user might experience when locating and booking a vaccine appointment in the state of Nevada. Disclaimer: This site should NOT be used for medical, covid, or vaccine related information.

## Sign-in/out

Users can sign in or out from any page of the site. The sign-in/sign-out buttons can be found by going to the user-icon in the upper right corner of the navigation bar and clicking the desired action in the drop down menu that will appear. It should also be noted that users can check whether they are signed in or not, and under which account, by visiting the drop down menu.

## Home Page

The home page allows users to select a Nevada county. After the selection is made, a list of vaccine sites in that selected county will appear. Users can then book an appointment at their desired location. The Admin account cannot book appointments. Users who are not logged in can still view appointment times and locaitons, however, the can't book them.

## Appointment Manager Page

The appointment manager page will list all of the user's currently booked appointments. If the user is not logged in, they will see a login screen in place of the appointent manager page. Once logged in, the user will also be given the option to make changes to their appointment(like rescheduling a date and time) and to cancel that appointment. The entire site is based around the assumption that only two-dose vaccines exist. As such, users will not be allowed from making more than two vaccine appointments. Once the user's appointment is finished, they have the option of marking it as complete. When logged in as an Admin, the appointment manager page will not be shown. Instead, the admin page will take its place.

## Profile Page

The profile page displays the currently logged in user's personal information(full name, username, and email), and displays a list of the user's completed vaccination appointments. There is also the option for the user to delete their account at the bottom of the page. The profile page link/option can be found by going to the user icon in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar. The profile page link will only be made available if the user is logged in. The Admin account does not have the profile page made available to them.

## Admin Page

The admin page allows the site administrator to add, delete, and edit information, such as adding new counties and new vaccine locations, as well as deleting and editing their properties. Only the admin can access this page. When logged in via admin credentials, the admin page link will appear in the navigation bar.
