## Overview

This is a website that mocks what a user might experience when locating and booking a vaccine appointment in the state of Nevada. Disclaimer: This site should NOT be used for medical, covid, or vaccine related information.

## Home Page

The home page allows users to select a Nevada county. After the selection is made, a list of vaccine sites in that selected county will appear. Users can then book an appointment at their desired location. 

## Appointment Manager Page

The appointment manager page will list all of the user's currently booked appointments. The user will also be given the option to make changes to their appointment(like rescheduling a date and time) and to cancel that appointment. The entire site is based around the assumption that only two-dose vaccines exist. As such, users will not be allowed from making more than two vaccine doses.
